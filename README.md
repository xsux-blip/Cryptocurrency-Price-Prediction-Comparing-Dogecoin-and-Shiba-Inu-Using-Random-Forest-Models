# Price Prediction of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Coin

## Project Description
This project aims to predict the prices of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Coin based on historical data. We compare the performance of the Random Forest model used for both coins and identify the factors that most influence their prices, such as trading volume and market capitalization.

## Random Forest Model

### Prediction Results

- **Dogecoin:**
  - MSE: 0.00237
  - R-squared: 0.5505

- **Shiba Inu:**
  - MSE: 5.596875e-11
  - R-squared: 0.5370

### Advantages
- Random Forest provides good performance with low MSE results and a reasonably high R-squared.
- This model effectively handles complex data and requires minimal preprocessing.

### Disadvantages
- Although reasonably accurate, Random Forest does not always provide easy interpretation due to the complexity of the decision trees used.
